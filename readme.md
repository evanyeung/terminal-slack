## Setup

Note: This project requires Node v6.0.0 or higher.

To connect to Slack, the app uses a Slack API token. This can be found at https://api.slack.com/web and must be added to your environment variables. To do this, copy it and run the command `$ export SLACK_TOKEN='[your token here]'` (or add it to your environment variables in an equivalent fashion). Run the app with `$ node main.js`.
